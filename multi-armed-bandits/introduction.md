# Introduction

What differentiates reinforcement learning from other types of learning is that in the process of training a model, it evaluates the actions taken. That is, we measure how good the action taken was.

A classic simplified form of reinforcement learning is the multi-armed bandit problem, whose name comes from a situation in which one plays a row of slot machines at a casino. The player can choose which machines to play, how many times to play each machine, and in which order to play them.
